This backend will support various functionalities required to mimic the core features of Airbnb, ensuring a smooth experience for users and hosts.

# Project Goals
User Management: Implement a secure system for user registration, authentication, and profile management.
Property Management: Develop features for property listing creation, updates, and retrieval.
Booking System: Create a booking mechanism for users to reserve properties and manage booking details.
Payment Processing: Integrate a payment system to handle transactions and record payment details.
Review System: Allow users to leave reviews and ratings for properties.
Data Optimization: Ensure efficient data retrieval and storage through database optimizations.

# Team Roles
Backend Developer: Responsible for implementing API endpoints, database schemas, and business logic.

Database Administrator: Manages database design, indexing, and optimizations.

DevOps Engineer: Handles deployment, monitoring, and scaling of the backend services.

QA Engineer: Ensures the backend functionalities are thoroughly tested and meet quality standards.

# Technology Stack
Django: A high-level Python web framework used for building the RESTful API.

Django REST Framework: Provides tools for creating and managing RESTful APIs.

PostgreSQL: A powerful relational database used for data storage.

GraphQL: Allows for flexible and efficient querying of data.

Celery: For handling asynchronous tasks such as sending notifications or processing payments.

Redis: Used for caching and session management.

Docker: Containerization tool for consistent development and deployment environments.

CI/CD Pipelines: Automated pipelines for testing and deploying code changes.

## Database Design üíæ

The application's data is managed using **PostgreSQL**, a powerful relational database. The structure is built around key entities representing the core components of the property rental platform: user management, property listings, bookings, payments, and reviews.

# Key Entities and Fields

**1. Users**
* **Fields:** `id` (Primary Key), `username`, `email`, `role` (Host, Guest, Admin), `join_date`
* **Description:** Stores user account information for authentication and defining roles (who can list properties vs. who can book them).

**2. Properties**
* **Fields:** `id` (Primary Key), `host_id` (Foreign Key to Users), `title`, `address`, `price_per_night`, `status` (Available, Booked)
* **Description:** Represents the rental listings, linking each property back to its host.

**3. Bookings**
* **Fields:** `id` (Primary Key), `guest_id` (Foreign Key to Users), `property_id` (Foreign Key to Properties), `start_date`, `end_date`, `total_price`, `status` (Confirmed, Pending)
* **Description:** Manages reservations, tracking which guest booked which property and for what duration.

**4. Reviews**
* **Fields:** `id` (Primary Key), `booking_id` (Foreign Key to Bookings), `reviewer_id` (Foreign Key to Users), `rating` (1-5), `comment`
* **Description:** Stores user feedback and ratings, ensuring a review is tied to a completed booking.

**5. Payments**
* **Fields:** `id` (Primary Key), `booking_id` (Foreign Key to Bookings), `amount`, `payment_method`, `transaction_status` (Succeeded, Failed)
* **Description:** Records the financial transactions associated with each booking.

---

### Entity Relationships

The entities are connected using **Foreign Keys (FKs)** to enforce data integrity and model real-world relationships, primarily through one-to-many ($\text{1:M}$) links.

* **Users** $\text{1:M}$ **Properties**: A **Host (User)** can list **multiple Properties**.
    * *Mechanism:* The `host_id` field in the **Properties** table links to the `id` in the **Users** table.

* **Users** $\text{1:M}$ **Bookings**: A **Guest (User)** can create **multiple Bookings**.
    * *Mechanism:* The `guest_id` field in the **Bookings** table links to the `id` in the **Users** table.

* **Properties** $\text{1:M}$ **Bookings**: A single **Property** can have **multiple Bookings** over time.
    * *Mechanism:* The `property_id` field in the **Bookings** table links to the `id` in the **Properties** table.

* **Bookings** $\text{1:1}$ **Payments**: Each **Booking** must have a corresponding **Payment** record.
    * *Mechanism:* The `booking_id` field in the **Payments** table links to the `id` in the **Bookings** table.

* **Bookings** $\text{1:M}$ **Reviews**: A completed **Booking** is required before a **Review** can be left.
    * *Mechanism:* The `booking_id` field in the **Reviews** table links to the `id` in the **Bookings** table.

# Feature Breakdown 

This project aims to replicate the core functionality of a property rental platform like Airbnb. The following main features are essential for a complete and functional system:


### 1. User Authentication and Authorization üîê

This feature handles user registration, login, and secure session management. It ensures that users are correctly identified and assigned roles (Guest or Host), which dictates their permissions, such as the ability to list a property versus the ability to make a booking.

### 2. Property Management (CRUD) üè†

Hosts can create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) their property listings through an intuitive interface. This allows hosts to manage property details like titles, descriptions, pricing, locations, and availability, ensuring that property data is always current and accurate for potential guests.

### 3. Search and Filtering üîé

Guests can efficiently discover properties by searching based on location, dates, and applying filters such as price range, number of guests, and amenities. This core search mechanism is critical for enhancing the user experience and matching guests with suitable listings quickly.

### 4. Booking System üóìÔ∏è

This system allows guests to select a property, choose check-in and check-out dates, and submit a reservation request. It manages the booking lifecycle, including calculating the total cost, handling booking conflicts, and updating the property's availability.

### 5. Review and Rating System ‚≠ê

Users can leave reviews and ratings for properties after a booking is complete, contributing to community trust. This feature provides social proof for hosts and helps future guests make informed decisions about where to stay.

### 6. Payments Integration üí≥

This feature handles the secure processing of financial transactions for bookings, integrating with an external payment gateway (e.g., Stripe). It ensures that payments are accurately recorded, funds are securely transferred, and the booking is confirmed upon successful payment.

### 7. Notification System üîî

Notifications are sent asynchronously for critical events, such as new booking requests, booking confirmations, payment failures, or review submissions. Leveraging **Celery** and **Redis**, this system ensures timely communication between Guests, Hosts, and the system without blocking the main application flow.
