## Database Design üíæ

The application's data is managed using **PostgreSQL**, a powerful relational database. The structure is built around key entities representing the core components of the property rental platform: user management, property listings, bookings, payments, and reviews.

# Key Entities and Fields

**1. Users**
* **Fields:** `id` (Primary Key), `username`, `email`, `role` (Host, Guest, Admin), `join_date`
* **Description:** Stores user account information for authentication and defining roles (who can list properties vs. who can book them).

**2. Properties**
* **Fields:** `id` (Primary Key), `host_id` (Foreign Key to Users), `title`, `address`, `price_per_night`, `status` (Available, Booked)
* **Description:** Represents the rental listings, linking each property back to its host.

**3. Bookings**
* **Fields:** `id` (Primary Key), `guest_id` (Foreign Key to Users), `property_id` (Foreign Key to Properties), `start_date`, `end_date`, `total_price`, `status` (Confirmed, Pending)
* **Description:** Manages reservations, tracking which guest booked which property and for what duration.

**4. Reviews**
* **Fields:** `id` (Primary Key), `booking_id` (Foreign Key to Bookings), `reviewer_id` (Foreign Key to Users), `rating` (1-5), `comment`
* **Description:** Stores user feedback and ratings, ensuring a review is tied to a completed booking.

**5. Payments**
* **Fields:** `id` (Primary Key), `booking_id` (Foreign Key to Bookings), `amount`, `payment_method`, `transaction_status` (Succeeded, Failed)
* **Description:** Records the financial transactions associated with each booking.

---

### Entity Relationships

The entities are connected using **Foreign Keys (FKs)** to enforce data integrity and model real-world relationships, primarily through one-to-many ($\text{1:M}$) links.

* **Users** $\text{1:M}$ **Properties**: A **Host (User)** can list **multiple Properties**.
    * *Mechanism:* The `host_id` field in the **Properties** table links to the `id` in the **Users** table.

* **Users** $\text{1:M}$ **Bookings**: A **Guest (User)** can create **multiple Bookings**.
    * *Mechanism:* The `guest_id` field in the **Bookings** table links to the `id` in the **Users** table.

* **Properties** $\text{1:M}$ **Bookings**: A single **Property** can have **multiple Bookings** over time.
    * *Mechanism:* The `property_id` field in the **Bookings** table links to the `id` in the **Properties** table.

* **Bookings** $\text{1:1}$ **Payments**: Each **Booking** must have a corresponding **Payment** record.
    * *Mechanism:* The `booking_id` field in the **Payments** table links to the `id` in the **Bookings** table.

* **Bookings** $\text{1:M}$ **Reviews**: A completed **Booking** is required before a **Review** can be left.
    * *Mechanism:* The `booking_id` field in the **Reviews** table links to the `id` in the **Bookings** table.

# Feature Breakdown 

This project aims to replicate the core functionality of a property rental platform like Airbnb. The following main features are essential for a complete and functional system:


### 1. User Authentication and Authorization üîê

This feature handles user registration, login, and secure session management. It ensures that users are correctly identified and assigned roles (Guest or Host), which dictates their permissions, such as the ability to list a property versus the ability to make a booking.

### 2. Property Management (CRUD) üè†

Hosts can create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) their property listings through an intuitive interface. This allows hosts to manage property details like titles, descriptions, pricing, locations, and availability, ensuring that property data is always current and accurate for potential guests.

### 3. Search and Filtering üîé

Guests can efficiently discover properties by searching based on location, dates, and applying filters such as price range, number of guests, and amenities. This core search mechanism is critical for enhancing the user experience and matching guests with suitable listings quickly.

### 4. Booking System üóìÔ∏è

This system allows guests to select a property, choose check-in and check-out dates, and submit a reservation request. It manages the booking lifecycle, including calculating the total cost, handling booking conflicts, and updating the property's availability.

### 5. Review and Rating System ‚≠ê

Users can leave reviews and ratings for properties after a booking is complete, contributing to community trust. This feature provides social proof for hosts and helps future guests make informed decisions about where to stay.

### 6. Payments Integration üí≥

This feature handles the secure processing of financial transactions for bookings, integrating with an external payment gateway (e.g., Stripe). It ensures that payments are accurately recorded, funds are securely transferred, and the booking is confirmed upon successful payment.

### 7. Notification System üîî

Notifications are sent asynchronously for critical events, such as new booking requests, booking confirmations, payment failures, or review submissions. Leveraging **Celery** and **Redis**, this system ensures timely communication between Guests, Hosts, and the system without blocking the main application flow.

# API Security üîí

Securing the backend APIs is non-negotiable for protecting user data, maintaining system integrity, and ensuring compliance. Our strategy relies on several key security measures implemented across the technology stack, particularly within **Django REST Framework** and **GraphQL**.

---

### Key Security Measures

| Measure | Implementation Detail | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Authentication** | **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** or **OAuth2** | Ensures that all requests originate from a verified and logged-in user. Every request must carry a valid token, preventing unauthorized access to protected resources. |
| **Authorization** | **Permissions Classes** (DRF/Django) | Restricts what an authenticated user is *allowed* to do. For example, a Guest can only view available properties, and a Host can only edit *their own* listings. |
| **Rate Limiting** | **Redis** and **Django Middleware** | Limits the number of requests a user (identified by IP or API key/token) can make within a defined time frame. This mitigates **Denial-of-Service (DoS)** attacks and prevents API abuse (e.g., rapid attempts to guess passwords). |
| **Input Validation** | **Django Forms/Serializers** | Strictly validates all incoming data (e.g., checking that prices are positive numbers, dates are correctly formatted, and string lengths are reasonable). This prevents common vulnerabilities like **SQL Injection** and **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**. |
| **HTTPS/SSL** | **TLS Encryption** | Ensures all data transmitted between the client (browser/mobile app) and the server is encrypted. This prevents sensitive information (passwords, payment details) from being intercepted by attackers (**Man-in-the-Middle attacks**). |

### Importance of Security by Project Area

Security is crucial across the entire platform, but its importance is highlighted in specific areas:

* **Protecting User Data:** Strong **Authentication** and **Authorization** are vital to prevent unauthorized access to user profiles, personal contact details, and booking history, maintaining user privacy and trust.
* **Securing Payments:** The **Payments** API must be protected by **HTTPS/TLS** and strict **Authorization** to ensure that sensitive financial information is encrypted during transit and that only the authorized system components can initiate or query transaction status.
* **Maintaining Data Integrity (Properties/Bookings):** Implementing robust **Authorization** (e.g., ensuring a Host can only modify their own properties) and **Input Validation** prevents malicious or accidental corruption of core business data, like prices, availability, and booking records.
* **Preventing System Abuse:** **Rate Limiting** and strong authentication protect the API from brute-force attacks on login endpoints and excessive scraping of property listings, thus ensuring service availability and controlling infrastructure costs.

# CI/CD Pipeline üöÄ

### What is CI/CD?

**CI/CD** stands for **Continuous Integration** and **Continuous Delivery/Deployment**. It's an automated methodology that introduces automation and continuous monitoring throughout the application lifecycle.

* **Continuous Integration (CI):** Developers merge code changes frequently (e.g., several times a day) into a main branch. An automated build process then runs tests and static analysis to instantly detect and fix integration errors.
* **Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CD):** After successful CI, the code is automatically prepared for release (Delivery) or automatically deployed (Deployment) to staging or production environments.

### Importance to the Project

The CI/CD pipeline is crucial for this project because it automates the process of testing and deploying our code, ensuring a **fast, reliable, and consistent release cycle**. This significantly reduces the risk of human error during deployment, allows for quick bug fixes, and ensures that features are delivered to users rapidly and reliably. It provides immediate feedback on the health and quality of every code change.

### Tools for Implementation

The pipeline integrates several tools from our technology stack:

* **GitHub Actions / GitLab CI / Jenkins:** These are common choices for orchestrating the pipeline stages (e.g., triggering on a push, running checks). We will use one of these tools to define the automated workflow.
* **Docker:** Used to build consistent, isolated containers for the application and its dependencies. The CI pipeline will build and tag new Docker images upon successful testing.
* **Django Testing Framework:** Ensures that all unit and integration tests run automatically during the CI stage to validate code functionality.
* **PostgreSQL / Redis (Test Instances):** Used in the CI environment to run integration tests against actual database and caching services.
